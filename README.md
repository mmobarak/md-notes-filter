# Markdown Notes Filter (md-notes-filter)

## Description

md-notes-filter is a UNIX command-line style filter that transforms notes written in Markdown using templates and/or command line arguments. 
It can work in conjunction with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and its [Templater](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/) plugin using
[Templater System Commands](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/user-functions/system-user-functions.html).

## Rationale

Why not just use Obsidian's and the Templater plugin's Javascipt APIs directly. Why reinvent this wheel?

- Obsidian is closed source and might disappear or become expensive one day. The attendant problems are obvious.
- I hate Javascript
- I want to learn Rust and this tool brings a concrete focus to doing so.
